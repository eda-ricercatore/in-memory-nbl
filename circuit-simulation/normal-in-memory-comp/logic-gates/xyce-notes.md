#	Technology Libraries





##	Default/Built-in Importing Technology Library


List of tables in https://prod-ng.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/2016/165198.pdf
+ Chapter/Section 2 has information about BSIM3, BSIM4, and BSIM6 device models, as well as memristor TEAM device models, and BSIM-CMG FinFETs (Table 2.88 and 2.89)



##	Instantiating Components


+ \cite[\S2.3, pp. 140-141, Table 2-30]{Keiter2019a}
	- Provides Information about how to instantiate components in Xyce's
		device/technology library.
+ \cite[\S4.2, pp. 35-37, Table 4-2]{Keiter2019}
	- Also, provides Information about how to instantiate components in Xyce's
	device/technology library.
+ Using FinFETs
	- \cite[\S2.3.20.12, pp. 431-432, Table 2-102]{Keiter2019a} describes the
		device instance parameters of the BSIM-CMG FinFETs.
		* The default feature size of the FinFET is 30 nm (3e-08 m).
		* \cite[\S2.3.20.12, pp. 431-432, Table 2-102]{Keiter2019a}

##	Power Analysis

+ \cite[\S6.1.8, pp. 579]{Keiter2019a} describes how to measure power dissipation
	in a circuit/device.
+ https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_it_possible_to_calculate_the_static_dynamic_power_dissipation_using_the_data_exported_from_SPICE_Deck
 + \cite[\S2.3, pp. 142-145, Table 2-31]{Keiter2019a}
	- Indicates whether each component in the Xyce device library supports
		power analysis.
