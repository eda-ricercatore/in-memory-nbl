https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2017.8009149
The future of the silicon-based economy will not be as pessimistic as some commentators have argued, given their predictions of the end of Moore's Law Economy (ME) by the early 2020s. On the contrary, a Virtual Moore's Law Economy (VME) will develop and thrive, advancing innovation by a new Silicon Way of producing various application-driven Heterogeneous Integrated (HI) Nano-systems by optimization of physics, materials, devices, circuits/chips, software and systems to enable exciting applications for business growth. The semiconductor industry will enjoy sufficient financial returns from new application and system-product sales, even considering more expensive silicon investment. Such a technological approach based on a (Function × Value)-Scaling Down-Plus-Up Methodology, in addition to Linear-Scaling, Area-Scaling and Volumetric-Scaling Methodologies, can fundamentally change the way of thinking and execution toward optimizing coherently both technology definition and final system design with an holistic HIDAS (HI Design/Architecture/System) method. This will drive IC scaling to an effective 1-Nanometer Realm, stimulating a thriving silicon industry which can have at least 30 more years of growth toward a 1 trillion-dollar size.

Scaling the Power Wall: A Path to Exascale






For general-purpose processors, much of the motivation for multi-core processors comes from greatly diminished gains in processor performance from increasing the operating frequency. This is due to three primary factors:[9]
The memory wall; the increasing gap between processor and memory speeds. This, in effect, pushes for cache sizes to be larger in order to mask the latency of memory. This helps only to the extent that memory bandwidth is not the bottleneck in performance.
The ILP wall; the increasing difficulty of finding enough parallelism in a single instruction stream to keep a high-performance single-core processor busy.
The power wall; the trend of consuming exponentially increasing power (and thus also generating exponentially increasing heat) with each factorial increase of operating frequency. This increase can be mitigated by "shrinking" the processor by using smaller traces for the same logic. The power wall poses manufacturing, system design and deployment problems that have not been justified in the face of the diminished gains in performance due to the memory wall and ILP wall.[citation needed]

Quality Configurable Approximate DRAM




All of these fine-grained techniques have to contend with the Horowitz imbalance, to coin a phrase: the huge discrepancy between the cost of processor control with respect to “real work.” Even if an FU operation were free, the benefit would be irrelevant compared to the cost of fetching, decoding, and scheduling the instruction that invoked it. These fine-grained approximation strategies are no longer worth pursuing on their own.

A de facto standard threshold of 10% error has emerged, which is both a triumph in consistency and a tragedy in real-world relevance.
Arbitrary thresholds and researcher-invented quality metrics are worth griping about, but most of what needs to be said about this sorry state of affairs has already been said. The system is not perfect, but PARSEC is not a perfect representation of all parallel computation workloads; Gem5 is not a perfect model of real CPUs; and geometric mean speedup is not a perfect proxy for utility. No standard evaluation strategy is without flaws. We should constantly work to develop better quality metrics and to understand thresholds that actually matter to users, but it is no longer useful to complain about the basic system of quality metrics and thresholds.
Approximation is compulsory in AI domains like vision, natural language understanding, and speech recognition, for example, so these fields already have established methodologies for measuring accuracy. These established metrics, like word error rate for speech recognition or mean average precision for object detection, are certainly not perfect, but their flaws are intimately understood by ML and AI researchers. Real-time 3D rendering is another example: approximations abound in the effort to draw a subjectively beautiful scene at a high frame rate.

To cross-correlate 1d arrays use numpy.correlate.
For 2d arrays, use scipy.signal.correlate2d.
There is also scipy.stsci.convolve.correlate2d.
There is also matplotlib.pyplot.xcorr which is based on numpy.correlate.
See this post on the SciPy mailing list for some links to different implementations.

#	To-Do List


+ rename statistics package to something else, and do regression testing to verify that it broke nothing.
	- statistic_pkg



+ finish automated regression for the *data analysis tool*:
	- data_analysis_tool.py
		* get_relative_error(experimental_value=1,theoretical_value=1).
		* get_percent_error(experimental_value=1,theoretical_value=1).
		* get_arithmetic_average_of_absolute_values(list_of_numbers=[]).
		* get_relative_difference(quantity1=1,quantity2=1).
		* get_relative_difference_friendly_version(quantity1=1,quantity2=1).
		* get_relative_percentage_difference_friendly_version(quantity1=1,quantity2=1).
		* get_relative_percentage_difference(quantity1=1,quantity2=1).
	- data_analysis_tool_tester.py
